	<h1>Coming Out Soon</h1>
	<p>Looking forward to these reads!!!! I've been waiting forever for the next Morrigan Crow...</p>

	Note: KOTLC 10, next Sword Catcher, next Morrigan Crow, next Percy Jackson

	<h3><b> KOTLC 10 </b></h3>
<img src="Book10.jpg" alt="KOTLC"/>
<p><i> Yeah...does this series ever end? I won't be too scathing, though, because my review <a href="Donotread.html">here</a> was kinda mean. </i></p>

<h3><b> Sword Catcher 2 </b></h3>
<img src="RagpickerKing.jpg" alt="I hate cliffhangers"/>
<p><i> Sooo </i> Sword Catcher <i> ended on a huge cliffhanger so I cannot WAIT for </i> The Ragpicker King <i>. Unfortunately it's not scheduled to come out until sometime in 2025 *sobs* </i></p>

<h3><b> Silverborn </b></h3>
<img src="Silverborn.jpg" alt="InfernoMaster"/>
<p> Silverborn <i> kept getting delayed, it was meant to come out in 2022, so I'll have to reread the other three to remember what happened before I read this one... anyway, here's hoping it's as good as the original three! </i></p>

<h3><b> Wrath of the Triple Goddess </b></h3>
<img src="WrathTripleGoddess.jpg" alt="Annabeth is the best"/>
<p> Wrath of the Triple Goddess <i> and </i> The Chalice of the Gods <i> are newer PJO books that add on to the original five as Percy Jackson attempts to get into college. Of course, he's a demigod, so that means he has to risk his life for college recommendations. </i></p>
