		<h1> Standalones </h1>
	<p>Some of these really should be series...anyway, I included duos in here, because a series is technically 3+ books. Enjoy!!!</p>

<h3><b> Six of Crows & King of Scars Duologies </b></h3>
<img src="SixofCrows.jpg" alt="crowcrowcrow"/>
<p><i> I'm not sure a summary can do this justice, but here I go... six teenage kids, outcasts and criminals, attempt to break into the unbreakable Ice Court and make it out alive. (WYLAN AND JESPER FOREVER <3 <3 <3)</i></p>

<h3><b> Sword Catcher </b></h3>
<img src="SwordCatcher.jpg" alt="Why are there so many Kells?"/>
<p><i> Kell, the crown prince's sworn protector and body double, knows his destiny is to die for the prince. Lin, a young Ashkar (doctor who heals using magic), attempts to return magic to the world. And then obviously there's the romance (spoiler alert) </p></i>

<h3><b> Strike the Zither Duology </b></h3>
<img src="StrikeZither.jpg" alt="I forget"/>
<p><i> Zephyr, one of the best strategists of the Xin Dynasty, will go to any length to help her warlordess gain the throne...even come back from the dead (Well, kind of dead. It's confusing. You'll understand when you read it). I haven't actually read the second book because I can't find it anywhere, but the first was amazing!!</i></p>

<h3><b> Six Crimson Cranes Duology </b></h3>
<img src="SixCrimsonCranes.jpeg" alt="dragonnnnsssss"/>
<p><i> Banished by her stepmother, Shiori must find her brothers and break the curse and hide the forbidden magic she possesses and defeat her stepmother and avoid her betrothed...lots of stuff to do! That's probably why there's a sequal. It's really good and a lot goes on in a relatively short/medium-length book! </i></p>
