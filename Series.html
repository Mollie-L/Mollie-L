		<h1>Series</h1>
	<p>These are my favorite comfort books!! They go in order of books you probably have to less common books.</p>

<h3><b> Harry Potter </b></h3>
<img src="HarryPottah.PNG" alt="Mr. POTTAAAAAH"/>
<p><i> I'm not going to bother writing a summery. We all know Harry. If you don't, go <a href="Potter.html">here.</a> </i></p>

<h3><b> Percy Jackson </b></h3>

<p><i> Percy discovers that he is son of the Greek god Poseidon. Five books later, he meets the Roman gods and some of their demigod kids. Then he meets Magnus Chase and the Norse gods. Then he meets Sadie and Carter Kane and the Egyptian gods. There are loads and loads of books and will keep you busy for a looong time!! </i></p>

<h3><b> Keeper Of The Lost Cities </b></h3>
<img src="KOTLC.jpg" alt="Sophie has love problems"/>
<p><i> Sophie Foster discovers that she is an elf and goes to live in the Lost Cities. Right as she's beginning to feel at home, disaster strikes...again...and again...and again...Eleven books in total, including books 8.5 and 9.5.</p></i>

<h3><b> The Land of Stories </b></h3>
<img src="TheLandofStories.jpg" alt="TLOS"/>
<p><i> Twin siblings Alex and Conner discover a new world filled with fairy tale characters by falling through their grandmother's old storybook. They go on endless quests to save the world from everything from dragons to old (and I mean REALLY old) French generals. </i></p>

<h3><b> Morrigan Crow </b></h3>
<img src="Hollowpoxx.jpg" alt="TLOS"/>
<p><i> Morrigan Crow is cursed to die on midnight on her eleventh birthday - until an ecstatic, remarkable, and very ginger man named Jupiter North whisks her away to Nevermoor, a secret city hidden inside of her country. There, she must compete for a place within the Wundrous Society while strange incidents hint at the return of Nevermoor's oldest enemy...</i></p>

<h3><b> Shadow and Bone </b></h3>
<img src="ShadowandBone.jpg" alt="WUNDERSMITH WUNDERSMITH WUNDERSMITH"/>
<p><i> Alina Starkov discovers that she has a rare power, the first sun summoner known to her kingdom, and may be the key to saving her torn country. It's also a two-season Netflix series that is AMAZING!!!! It unfortunately got discontinued but I highly recommend. There are also two sets of duologies set in the same world which I talk about 
<a href="Standalones.html">here.</a></i></p>

<h3><b> A Darker Shade of Magic </b></h3>
<img src="KellAntari.jpg" alt="WE LOVE LILA"/>
<p><i> Kell is one of the last two Antari, those who can travel between Londons. Lila is a thief in Gray London who dreams of the sea and will kill you if you call her Delilah. When Kell unleashes a deadly magic artifact from the dreaded Black London, the two must fix it before it kills literally everyone (and I know that makes it sound cheesy but believe me it's really good). Also don't confuse this Kell with the Kell from Sword Catcher! Who knew Kell was such a popular name? </i></p>
